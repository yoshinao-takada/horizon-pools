<big>Top Copper</big>
Elements placed on this layer describe which parts of the copper layer remain on the PCB after etching (relative to the part orientation).

Per default it will be covered by the solder mask. Use the Top Mask layer to expose bare copper.

For pads use the <a href="t:PLACE_PAD">Place Pad Tool</a>
