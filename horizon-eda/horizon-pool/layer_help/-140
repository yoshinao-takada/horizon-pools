<big>Bottom Package</big>
Used for visualizing the package outline, so it should follow the packages nominal dimensions. You may use the <a href="t:IMPORT_DXF">import DXF</a> tool for importing a DXF drawing obtained from a STEP model or otherwise.

Since the package outline's purpose is purely visual, you can use either lines or polygons. Only include pins if they significantly contribute to the packages appearance.
