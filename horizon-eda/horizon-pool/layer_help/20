<big>Top Silkscreen</big>
Should clarify a parts location and orientation during manual assembly and visual inspection.

Include some sort of pin 1 marker if the part is orientation-sensitive. Do not use a dot, but shorten/elongate the silkscreen graphics instead. 

Also <a href="t:PLACE_TEXT">place a text "$RD"</a> on the silkscreen layer. Both the text and the graphics should use a line width of 0.15mm.

The silksceen should leave a space of at least 0.2mm to the package outline.
