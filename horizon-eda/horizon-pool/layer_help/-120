<big>Bottom Silkscreen</big>
Should clarify a parts location and orientation during manual assembly and visual inspection. Most of the time you should use the Top Silkscreen layer, because this is where the part would be placed.

Include some sort of pin 1 marker if the part is orientation-sensitive. Do not use a dot, but shorten/elongate the silkscreen graphics instead. 

Also <a href="t:PLACE_TEXT">place a text "$RD"</a> on the silkscreen layer. Both the text and the graphics should use a line width of 0.15mm.

The silksceen should leave a space of at least 0.2mm to the package outline.
